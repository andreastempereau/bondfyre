Metro has encountered an error: Failed to get the SHA-1 for: /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/expo/node_modules/metro-runtime/src/polyfills/require.js.
  Potential causes:
    1) The file is not watched. Ensure it is under the configured `projectRoot` or `watchFolders`.
    2) Check `blockList` in your metro.config.js and make sure it isn't excluding the file path.
    3) The file may have been deleted since it was resolved - try refreshing your app.
    4) Otherwise, this is a bug in Metro or the configured resolver - please report it.: /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/expo/node_modules/metro/src/node-haste/DependencyGraph.js (28:3)
